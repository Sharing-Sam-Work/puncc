=======

The **API** offers more flexibility into defining conformal prediction wrappers.
Let's say we want to fit/calibrate a neural-network interval-estimator with a cross-validation plan;
or that we want to experiment different user-defined nonconformity scores.
In such cases and others, the user can fully construct their wrappers using the
proposed **Predictor-Calibrator-Splitter** paradigm. It boils down to assembling
into :class:`deel.puncc.conformalization.ConformalPredictor`:

* Prediction model(s).
* An estimator of nonconformity scores for construction/calibration of prediction intervals.
* A strategy of data assignement into fitting and calibration sets.

ConformalPredictor
------------------

:class:`deel.puncc.conformalization.ConformalPredictor` is the canvas of conformal prediction wrappers.
An object instance is constructed by, as we will explain later, a predictor, a calibrator and a splitter:

.. code-block:: python

    # Imports
    from sklearn import linear_model
    from deel.puncc.api.conformalization import ConformalPredictor
    from deel.puncc.api.predictor import MeanPredictor
    from deel.puncc.api.calibration import MeanCalibrator
    from deel.puncc.api.splitter import KFoldSplit

    # Regression linear model
    model = linear_model.LinearRegression()

    # Definition of mean-based predictor, a mean-based calibrator and a K-fold splitter
    # (This will be explained later)
    mean_predictor = MeanPredictor(model) # Predictor
    mean_calibrator = MeanCalibrator() # Calibrator
    kfold_splitter = KFoldSplitter(K=20, random_state=42) # Splitter

    # Conformal prediction canvas
    conformal_predictor = ConformalPredictor(predictor=mean_predictor,
                                            calibrator=mean_calibrator,
                                            splitter=kfold_splitter)

:class:`deel.puncc.conformalization.ConformalPredictor` implements two methods:


* A :func:`fit` method that fits the predictor model and computes nonconformity scores accodingly to the calibrator and to the data split strategy provided by the splitter

.. code-block:: python

    # X_train and y_train are the full training dataset
    # The splitter passed as argument to ConformalPredictor assigns data
    # to the fit and calibration sets based on the provided splitting strategy
    conformal_predictor.fit(X_train, y_train)

* And a :func:`predict` method that estimates for new samples a 90% (1-alpha) coverage prediction interval [y_pred_low, y_pred_high] and point predictions if applicable (e.g., conditional mean)

.. code-block:: python

    # Coverage target of 1-alpha = 90%
    y_pred, y_pred_low, y_pred_high, sigma_pred = conformal_predictor.predict(X_new, alpha=.1)

Predictor
---------

The :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.BasePredictor` class is a wrapper for prediction models
that aims to standardize their interface and force compliance with the previously presented requirements:

* The models have to implement the :func:`fit` and :func:`predict` methods.
* The models have to operate on datasets formated as numpy arrays.

Any specific preprocessing should be included in a **subclass** of :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.BasePredictor`.

A special attention is to be directed towards the :func:`predict` method.

.. code-block:: python

    # Args:
    #   X: new example features
    # Returns:
    #   A tuple composed of (y_pred, y_pred_lower, y_pred_upper, sigma_pred)
    predict(X: numpy.array) -> (numpy.array, numpy.array, numpy.array, numpy.array)

The tuple returned by the method contains four elements:
*   `y_pred`: point predictions
*   `y_pred_lower`: lower bound of the prediction intervals
*   `y_pred_upper`: upper bound of the prediction intervals
*   `sigma_pred`: variability estimations

If the model does not estimate some of these values, they are substituted by `None` at the right position.
For example, a quantile regressor that returns upper and lower interval bounds is wrapped as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    class QuantilePredictor(BasePredictor):
        def __init__(self, q_lo_model, q_hi_model, is_trained=False):
            """
            Args:
                q_lo_model: lower quantile model
                q_hi_model: upper quantile model
            """
            super().__init__(is_trained)
            self.q_lo_model = q_lo_model
            self.q_hi_model = q_hi_model

        def fit(self, X, y, **kwargs):
            """Fit model to the training data.
            Args:
                X: train features
                y: train labels
            """
            self.q_lo_model.fit(X, y)
            self.q_hi_model.fit(X, y)
            self.is_trained = True

        def predict(self, X, **kwargs):
            """Compute predictions on new examples.
            Args:
                X: new examples' features
            Returns:
                y_pred, y_lower, y_upper, sigma_pred
            """
            y_pred_lower = self.q_lo_model.predict(X)
            y_pred_upper = self.q_hi_model.predict(X)
            return None, y_pred_lower, y_pred_upper, None

To cover a large range of conformal prediction methods, three subclasses of :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.BasePredictor` have been implemented:

* :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.MeanPredictor`: wrapper of point-based models
* :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.MeanVarPredictor`: wrapper of point-based models that also estimates variability statistics (e.g., standard deviation)
* :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.QuantilePredictor`: wrapper of specific interval-based models that estimate upper and lower quantiles of the data generating distribution

PS: User-defined predictors have to subclass :class:`deel.puncc.api.prediction.BasePredictor` and redefine its methods.

Calibrator
----------

The :class:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.Calibrator` is meant to compute **nonconformity scores** (e.g., residuals)
on the calibration dataset (:func:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.Calibrator.estimate` method)
and uses them to **construct** and/or **calibrate** prediction intervals (:func:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.Calibrator.calibrate` method).

To cover a large range of conformal prediction methods, three subclasses of :class:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.Calibrator` have been implemented:

* :class:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.MeanCalibrator`: constructs prediction intervals based on point predictions by adding and substracting quantiles of mean absolute deviations
* :class:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.MeanVarCalibrator`: constructs prediction intervals based on point predictions and dispersion estimations by adding and substracting quantiles of **scaled** mean absolute deviations
* :class:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.QuantileCalibrator`: calibrates quantile-based prediction intervals by shrinking or dialating them accordingly to the quantiles of nonconformity scores

PS: User-defined calibrators have to subclass :class:`deel.puncc.api.calibration.Calibrator` and redefine its methods.

Splitter
--------

In conformal prediction, the assignement of data to fitting and calibration sets is motivated by two criteria: data availability and computational resources. If quality data is abundant, we can split the training samples into disjoint subsets $D_{fit}$ and $D_{calib}$. When data is scarce, a cross-validation strategy is preferred but is more ressources consuming as different models are trained and nonconformity scores are computed for different disjoint folds.

The two plans are implemented in :mod:`deel.puncc.api.splitting` module.
* :class:`deel.puncc.api.splitting.RandomSplitter`: assignement of samples in $D_{fit}$ and $D_{calib}$
* :class:`deel.puncc.api.splitting.KFoldSplitter`: assignement of samples into K disjoint folds. Note that if K equals the size of training set, the split is identified with the leave-one-out strategy

These methods produce **iterables** that are used by the :class:`ConformalPredictor` instance.

Additionnaly, if the user already implemted a split plan, the obtained data asignement is wrapped in :class:`deel.puncc.api.splitting.IdSplitter` to produce iterables.
